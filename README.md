# note-taker
In this project we assigned to create a note-taker app using Express. I really enjoyed doing this assignment since is was the beginning of the backend portion of the course. The only issue I had was deploying the actual application onto Heroku. I was not able to solve that issue but everything else ran perfectly fine.
